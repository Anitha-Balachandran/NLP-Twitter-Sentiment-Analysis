# Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Tweets

## Overview:
This mini-project involves building a sentiment analysis model for Twitter tweets using the Analytics Vidhya dataset from the Linguipedia Codefest - Natural Language Processing contest. The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of tweets.

## Tasks Implemented:
1. Data Preparation:
   - Obtained the training dataset from Analytics Vidhya's Linguipedia Codefest - Natural Language Processing contest.
   - Performed data cleaning and preprocessing steps, including tokenization, stopword removal, HTML tag stripping, lowercase conversion, and lemmatization/stemming.

2. Model Building:
   - Implemented multiple numerical representations for text data, such as TF-IDF, Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT and ELMo embeddings.
   - Explored different sequential models like RNN, LSTM, GRU, and BiLSTM for sentiment classification.
   - Trained and validated these models using the prepared dataset to achieve accurate sentiment prediction.

3. Evaluation and Optimization:
   - Evaluated the performance of each model using metrics like F1 score, accuracy.
   - Optimized the best-performing model by fine-tuning hyperparameters and checking learning curves and adjusting preprocessing techniques.


## Prerequisites for Vector Representations:
Before implementing the sentiment analysis model, ensure that you have downloaded the necessary files or libraries for each vector representation method:

1. **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):**
   - Downloaded BERT pre-trained models or relevant files.
   - Installed the Hugging Face Transformers library or another suitable BERT implementation.

2. **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):**
   - Installed Python libraries such as scikit-learn for TF-IDF vectorization.

3. **Word2Vec:**
   - Downloaded pre-trained Word2Vec embeddings or trained your own Word2Vec model.

4. **GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation):**
   - Downloaded GloVe pre-trained word embeddings or trained custom GloVe embeddings.

5. **ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models):**
   - Obtained pre-trained ELMo models or installed the TensorFlow Hub library for ELMo embeddings.


## Conclusion:
This mini-project demonstrates the process of building a sentiment analysis model for Twitter tweets using a combination of preprocessing techniques, numerical representations, and sequential models. The goal is to develop an accurate sentiment classifier, contributing to the field of natural language processing and sentiment analysis.
